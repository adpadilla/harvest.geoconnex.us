## About

This section contains code and resources for the end user of the system.  This would include notebooks, query examples and other material.

## Web

The web interface is build completely in HTML and Javascript. 
It communicates with the server side completely over APIs and 
other HTTP based calls.  

As such there are no direct dependancies between the two parts 
and the interface can be replaced or suplimented with other tooling.

For example,, more vertical interfaces into the graph and object store could take place easily based on open source packages such as [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) or [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).  These approaches would leverage work done in the noetbook section as well.
