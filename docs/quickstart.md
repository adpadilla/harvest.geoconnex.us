# Quick Start

## About 

This document provides a quick overview for the set up of a hosting 
environment and some initial simple indexing on a few providers.  

Though not a guide for a more production level implementation, it 
is very close in many regards. The main difference really being
that scaling and structure of the orchestration environment.   Here,
the environment is single host machine.
